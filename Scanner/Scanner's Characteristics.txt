The project is to write a scanner which has following characteristics:


1. All the variables start with "X" and two integers follow it. ex: x45

2. Each block starts with "start" and finishes with "finish".

3. Numbers can be both integer and float.

4. Conditions' structure are as the following:
	condition("whatever the condition is")
    	    start
    	    ...
	    finish

5. Loops are as following:
	loop
	until ("whatever the condition is")

6. Statements that are not a block statement, will end with "||", like ";" in c++.

7. For assignments, use ":=".

8. Use "integer" for integers, and "fpoint" for floats.

9. Operators are:
	+ 
	-
	/
	*
	>
	<
	>=
	<=
	=
	<>

10. Delemeters are:
	||
	)
	(
	:=

11. Comments starts with:
	//
(same as in c++)

12. Scanner should not create a token for empty lines and white spaces.
